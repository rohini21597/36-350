discover one day. We are a bunch of human beings on Earth who would like to extend you a warm welcome onto our planet. Let me tell you a bit
about myself. I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University in the country of the United States, in the state of Pennsylvania, in the city
of Pittsburgh. I am studying Statistics, and thanks to my wonderful professor, I have been granted the opportunity to discover a bunch of
new planets of which you all are soon-to-be residents")
